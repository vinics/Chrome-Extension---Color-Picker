## Special thanks
I would like to thank all people that made CS50 possible on edX. I was able to learn much more about the foundation of the computer science. This chrome extension was done as the final project required at the end of the course and I much satisfied with my progress througout the experience that is CS50.

My honest thanks to David J. Malan and all of the staff envolved with this amazing work and experience called CS50.
